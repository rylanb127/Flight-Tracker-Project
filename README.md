# ✈️ Flight Tracker Project

## 📋 Overview
This project is a mock flight tracker built with Python.  
It allows users to search for flights between major U.S. and European airports based on:
- Departure city and destination
- Date range
- Preferred class (Business or First Class)
- Flight type (Direct or Layover)

The system recommends the top 3 cheapest flights matching the user's criteria.
